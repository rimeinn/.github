## Hi there 👋

<!--

**Here are some ideas to get you started:**

🙋‍♀️ A short introduction - what is your organization all about?
🌈 Contribution guidelines - how can the community get involved?
👩‍💻 Useful resources - where can the community find your docs? Is there anything else the community should know?
🍿 Fun facts - what does your team eat for breakfast?
🧙 Remember, you can do mighty things with the power of [Markdown](https://docs.github.com/github/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax)

Here at **RimeInn**, we do **Rime Innovation**. We explore and experiment, search and research, and then push forward the state-of-the-art of typing technologies for various human languages, mostly based on [Rime](https://github.com/rime) and for [CJK](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CJK_characters).

- We create, maintain, and freely distribute innovative and high-quality input methods.
- We collaborate closely with upstream projects to actualize the high standards set by our projects, and also to benefit the broader community.
- We study and research optimal typing technologies, and make tools for IME analysis and construction.

RimeInn is a community of like-minded people -- we are not only skilled practitioners but also fearless visionaries. We welcome _your_ participation!
