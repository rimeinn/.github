## Hi there 👋

<!--

**Here are some ideas to get you started:**

🙋‍♀️ A short introduction - what is your organization all about?
🌈 Contribution guidelines - how can the community get involved?
👩‍💻 Useful resources - where can the community find your docs? Is there anything else the community should know?
🍿 Fun facts - what does your team eat for breakfast?
🧙 Remember, you can do mighty things with the power of [Markdown](https://docs.github.com/github/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax)

Here at **RimeInn**, we do **Rime Innovation**. We explore and experiment, search and research, and advance the state-of-the-art in typing technologies for a variety of human languages, with a particular focus on the [Rime](https://rime.im/) engine and [CJK](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CJK_characters) languages.

We:
- Create, maintain, and freely distribute **innovative and high-quality input methods**.
- **Collaborate closely with upstream projects** (including [Rime](https://rime.im/) and [Fcitx](https://fcitx-im.org/)) to uphold the high standards set by our initiatives, benefiting both our community and the broader ecosystem.
- Study and research **cutting-edge typing technologies**, providing tools for IME (Input Method Editor) construction and analysis.

RimeInn is a vibrant community of like-minded individuals -- we are not only skilled practitioners but also fearless visionaries. We welcome _your_ participation!
