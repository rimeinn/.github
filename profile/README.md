## Hi there 👋

RimeInn 是圍繞 [Rime 中州韻輸入法引擎](https://rime.im) 建立的、以 Rime 方案開發者爲核心的社區。

我們主要開發與維護：

- 📚 基於 Rime 的高級中文輸入方案
- ⚙️ 中文輸入方案的設計工具和分析工具
- 🖥 支持 Rime 方案開發的軟件和文檔
- 🚀 增强 Rime 引擎能力的插件

<!--

**Here are some ideas to get you started:**

🙋‍♀️ A short introduction - what is your organization all about?
🌈 Contribution guidelines - how can the community get involved?
👩‍💻 Useful resources - where can the community find your docs? Is there anything else the community should know?
🍿 Fun facts - what does your team eat for breakfast?
🧙 Remember, you can do mighty things with the power of [Markdown](https://docs.github.com/github/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax)


Here at **RimeInn**, we do **Rime Innovation**. We explore and experiment, search and research, and advance the state-of-the-art in typing technologies for a variety of human languages, with a particular focus on the [Rime](https://rime.im/) engine and [CJK](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CJK_characters) languages.

We:
- Create, maintain, and freely distribute **innovative and high-quality input methods**.
- Collect, fine-tune, and freely distribute **high-quality dictionaries** compiled by linguists.
- **Collaborate closely with upstream projects** (including [Rime](https://rime.im/) and [Fcitx](https://fcitx-im.org/)) to uphold the high standards set by our initiatives, benefiting both our community and the broader ecosystem.
- Study and research **cutting-edge typing technologies**, providing tools for input method construction and analysis.

RimeInn is a vibrant community of like-minded individuals -- we are not only skilled practitioners but also fearless visionaries. We welcome _your_ participation!
